# Machine_learning_WeatherAUS
Analysis and prediction using Rain in Australia dataset. Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow. 
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.
In this project i will clean, restructure the data and train different classifiers in order to obtain accurate classification. At the end
the results given by all the different classifiers will be compared.
